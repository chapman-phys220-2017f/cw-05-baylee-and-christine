# Instructor comments

1. Nicely done. Good examples for broadcasting and vectorization, and nice plots.
1. For the Lorentzian, you are still sampling a Gaussian (using randn). You should use the cauchy random sampling function instead as suggested in the notebook.
1. If you don't understand something (like the seaborn distplot function), don't be afraid to ask on Slack!
