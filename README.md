## Specification

1. With your partner, go through and complete the notebook `cw05.ipynb`. This notebook will demonstrate the implementation of useful functions, and how to plot them using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
1. With any extra time, create a new notebook `plots.ipynb` and implement a few of the more interesting exercises from the following `matplotlib` tutorial for practice : https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

It was helpful to learn how to plot with Matplotlib and Seaborn. It was helpful to see the graphs in 3D plots.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
